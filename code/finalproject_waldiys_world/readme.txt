A pretty simple platformer game for our final project. It's not too polished (especially the collision response and stuff) but it should be pretty easy to work off of this to make a full platformer game. 

BETA version is the one we made for the defense.

Abandoned already but at least it served a good way for the group to learn more about game dev.
